IPXWrapper README
=================

Introduction
------------

IPXWrapper allows using software that needs IPX/SPX support on recent versions
of Windows which no longer support it.

Quick start
-----------

Copy the four included DLL files to the directory containing the program that
needs it and run directplay-win32.reg or directplay-win64.reg, depending whether
you are running 32-bit or 64-bit Windows.

Choosing network interfaces
---------------------------

By default, IPXWrapper will operate on all network interfaces in the system,
which may not work correctly if you share more than one network with any other
systems running IPXWrapper.

To instead use a single network interface, change the "Primary interface" to
the interface you want to use. Some software may also require you to select the
interface in question inside it. Disabling all other interfaces may make this
easier.

Using a DOSBox IPX server
-------------------------

You can choose to use a DOSBox IPX server to communicate with other hosts
rather than exchanging packets directly, either to allow play over the Internet
or communication between Windows and DOS games (running under DOSBox).

To enable this, select the "DOSBox UDP encapsulation" option in ipxconfig and
enter the address/port of your DOSBox server.

**NOTE**: SPX connections are not supported when using this option.

Using the real IPX protocol
---------------------------

If your software needs to send/receive real IPX frames, for example because it
talks to an old piece of equipment that only understands IPX, install WinPcap
and select the "Real IPX encapsulation" option in ipxconfig.

**NOTE**: SPX connections are not supported when using this option.

Compatibility
-------------

Software that uses WinSock 1.x and/or DirectPlay (before version 8) is supported.
